# Aether Lint 2.0
> Refactoring: Design linting plugin for Figma.
### Features
1. Selecting a layer with an error in Figma will also select that layer, allowing you to navigate your page and fix errors with full context.
2. Aether Lint polls for changes and updates as you fix errors.
3. The "Ignore" and "Ignore All" buttons let you skip special layers.
4. Use the "Select All" option to fix multiple errors that share the same value at once.
5. Do you need to skip layers like illustrations? Locked layers in Figma will be skipped from linting.
6. Custom border radius values can be set in the settings and stored in Client Storage.
